    <p>Hello World,</p>

<p>My name is Matheus Beck and I’m passionate about learning new technologies and build things using code!</p>

<p>That’s why I decided to start this blog: to improve myself as a developer.</p>

<p>I’m from Brazil and I started programming in 2014 when I started the bachelor’s of computer engineering at Federal University of Bahia (UFBA). At UFBA, I learned a lot in the courses of Introduction to Logical Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Engineering and Operating Systems.</p>

<p>Until July of 2016, I have learned C, C++ and Java but I wasn’t so passionate about coding. It all changed in August 2016 when I got a scholarship from CAPES to study computer science for one year at <a href="http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/">Ensimag - Grenoble INP</a> in France through the BRAFITEC exchange program. At Grenoble, I learned French and I got a strong foundation in computer science. From there, I fell in love with programming.</p>

    <figcaption style="text-align: center">I'm also a big fan of Mr. Robot :)</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>When I returned to Brazil I got a job at <a href="http://www.consiste.com.br">Consiste Consultoria e Sistemas</a> as a developer intern. My main activities during one year were to develop agents (macros) using LotusScript and JavaScript to automate database tasks with IBM Domino and IBM Notes. I was also executing manual tests on the big data software called XTR powered by the company. Besides that, I was responsible to correct logic programming exams of candidates to internship.</p>

<p>After one year, I got my second internship at <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en">Ericsson Inovação S.A.</a> where I’m currently working. At Ericsson I’m working with the development of an automation framework for the telecom industry using Typescript, Node.js and Cucumber. I also worked with the execution of manual tests using RESTful Web Services on SoapUI, Postman and Apache JMeter and the development of automated tests using Ruby and Cucumber.</p>

<p>You can verify some of my projects on my <a href="http://www.github.com/matheus-beck/">GitHub</a> or my <a href="http://www.gitshowcase.com/matheus-beck">Portfolio Page</a> and I really hope to help you somehow in some programming topic.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
